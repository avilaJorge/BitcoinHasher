Bitcoin hashing fpga design optimized for delay.  This was the final project in the Advanced Digital Design course (ECE 111) at UC San Diego.

This was also the top delay-optimized design for [winter 2019](http://cwcserv.ucsd.edu/~billlin/classes/ECE111/index.php)

 #ALUTs = 26788
 #Regs = 22564
 Area = 49352
 Fmax = 184.26 MHz
 #Cycles = 223
 Delay (us) = 1.210
 Area*Delay (ms*area) = 59.728
